Simple Font Renderer
====================

This is an adaptation of https://github.com/ZoidTechnology/Simple-Font-Renderer to CMRX backend. It uses emulated framebuffer drawing instead of SDL3 routines.

Fonts saved in ../fonts directory were generated by the converted utility placed in the same repository.
